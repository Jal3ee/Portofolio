<h4> 1. Monthly Hotel Booking Analysis Based on Hotel Type</h4>
This analysis aims to discern booking trends for each hotel type. It can assist the company in better understanding the market and customer needs, enabling them to enhance operational efficiency and optimize revenue.

    Figure 1 — Percentage Ratio Graph of City Hotels and Resort Hotels
</p>
<br>

From the above plot, it's evident that **City Hotels are more favored by customers**, with a booking percentage of **66.41%**. These hotels are usually situated in city centers or urban areas, close to tourist and business locations, indicating that customers booking these hotels might have main activities around their stay. On the other hand, **Resort Hotels are booked by only 33.59% of customers**. These hotels are typically located in scenic areas like beaches, mountains, or quiet rural regions with comprehensive facilities. Customers booking these hotels likely have the intention of vacationing and relaxing in those locations.

<br>

Hotel bookings tend to experience an **increase during holiday seasons**, especially in the **May - August** period. Both types of hotels, City Hotels and Resort Hotels, have the highest booking values during this period, with a **significant increase in City Hotels**. This is likely due to the numerous national holidays in 2017-2019, such as public holidays and religious events (Ramadan), allowing people to go on vacations. Additionally, with the majority of Indonesia's population being Muslim and the cultural practices of "mudik" (returning to hometowns) and "silaturahmi" (visiting relatives) during Eid al-Fitr, people tend to travel far and require accommodation in the midst of their journeys, leading to hotel bookings.

During the holiday season in the **October - December** period, hotel bookings also increase but tend to be lower than in May - August. It's likely that many people prefer to celebrate major holidays like Christmas and New Year at home.

In the **January - March** period, hotel booking rates are **lowest**. This is likely due to the scarcity of national holidays during this period, and it coincides with the beginning of the new school year for students, not being a busy period for business travel activities early in the year. <br>

<h4> 2. Impact Analysis of Stay Duration on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rates</h4>
This analysis focuses on the relationship between the duration of stay and the cancellation rates of hotel bookings. According to data, approximately **19%** of hotel bookings made online are canceled before the customers arrive <a href="[https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.phocuswire.com/One-in-five-hotel-bookings-on-the-web-are-cancelled)">source</a>. These cancellations can reduce room availability and impact hotel revenue because every empty room can be a financial burden for that day. Additionally, if a hotel uses an Online Travel Agency (OTA), these cancellation rates can affect the hotel's ranking in search results <a href="[https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.hotelminder.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hotel-cancellations)">source</a>.

<br>

City Hotels also have a higher cancellation rate compared to Resort Hotels. This indicates that **customers booking City Hotels tend to cancel their reservations more frequently**. City Hotels, being centrally located in cities or urban areas and close to tourist and business locations, might have more activities to coordinate. This, along with other factors, could contribute to a higher rate of customers canceling their reservations.<br>
<br>

    Figure 5 — Cancellation Trends Based on Stay Duration
</p>
<br>

Based on the duration of stay, it is observed that **the cancellation rate of hotel bookings tends to increase with longer durations of stay**, both in City Hotels and Resort Hotels. In City Hotels, the cancellation rate increases significantly, with the percentage falling below 50% for a one-week duration. For stays of more than four weeks, Resort Hotels have a lower cancellation rate. In essence, both types of hotels exhibit **a positive trend, where the longer the duration of stay, the higher the likelihood of the reservation being canceled.**

The reason behind the increasing cancellation rate with longer stays could be evaluated and analyzed further by the company. Possible factors might include customer dissatisfaction. Customers staying in hotels for an extended period may have higher expectations and demand better service. If customers are dissatisfied with the hotel's service, they may decide to cancel their reservation and look for a better alternative. Additionally, higher costs could be a factor. Costs may exceed what customers expected or budgeted, leading them to seek more affordable alternatives.<br>

<h4> 3. Impact Analysis of Lead Time on Hotel Bookings Cancellation Rates</h4>

The analysis is conducted to understand the correlation between reservation cancellations and lead time. Lead time is the waiting period or the time gap between hotel booking and the arrival date.

<p align="center">

Pembatalan pemesanan **terendah** pada kedua tipe hotel terjadi pada *lead time* **kurang dari satu bulan**. Pembatalan **tertinggi hingga 60% terjadi pada City Hotel dengan *lead time* 10 bulan hingga 1 tahunan**. Sedangkan tren **Resort Hotel** memiliki tingkat pembatalan yang cukup **stagnan** dengan nilai **rata-rata 40%**.

The **lowest** booking cancellations for both hotel types occur with a lead time of **less than one month**. The **highest cancellation rate, up to 60%, occurs in City Hotels with a lead time of 10 months to 1 year**. Meanwhile, the trend for **Resort Hotels** shows a somewhat **stable cancellation rate with

Resort Hotels are likely more commonly used for vacations or recreational purposes, so customers tend to be more committed to their schedules and make fewer changes. Additionally, Resort Hotels, which may target customers seeking a more exclusive experience, might be better able to maintain their booking levels even when better offers are available elsewhere.

<h3>Results and Evaluation</h3>

1. Overall, City Hotels are the most frequently booked by customers. Significant increases in customer bookings occur during holiday seasons, namely May-July and October-December, for both hotel types. Business recommendations:
    
    - The company can optimize facilities and services at Resort Hotels since they have lower booking rates compared to City Hotels. Enhancing facilities like spas, gyms, or swimming pools and providing more personalized and friendly services can attract more customers to book rooms there.
    - Maximizing strategies for City Hotels, given their high popularity, can be profitable. Additional services for business purposes, such as meeting rooms or packages for events like seminars, can be offered.
    - Increasing promotions during holiday seasons, such as providing special discounts for guests booking a certain number of rooms or offering attractive vacation packages. The company may also consider implementing non-refundable policies to prevent booking cancellations.
    - During off-peak seasons, the company can combine flexible and non-refundable rates or offer special discounts with non-refundable conditions. 
    <br>
    <br>
2. Cancellation rates tend to increase with the length of stay for both hotel types. The cancellation rate at City Hotels significantly rises, with the lowest percentage for durations less than one week. Resort Hotels also experience an increasing cancellation rate, but it tends to be more stable. Recommendations for business:

    - The company should ensure robust cancellation policies to protect against potential revenue loss. Clearly communicating terms and conditions before booking, both online and offline, including information on refunds, cancellation fees, etc., can help. Stricter cancellation policies can have a significant impact and reduce fraudulent bookings.
    - Implement pricing strategies and limit the number of nights. Restricting flexible rates to a one-week range and providing non-refundable rates for longer stays can increase revenue and mitigate the risk of unwanted cancellations.
    - To prevent cancellations, the company can enhance services or offer excellent pre-stay services to improve customer satisfaction and reduce the likelihood of cancellations.<br>
    <br>

3. The lowest booking cancellations for both hotel types occur with a lead time of less than one month. City Hotels have the highest cancellation rate with a lead time of one year.

    - Both types of hotels may consider reducing lead times. By limiting the booking window, hotels can ensure that customers only book when they are genuinely certain about staying, reducing the likelihood of cancellations.
    - City Hotels can consider raising room rates to improve profit margins and decrease cancellation rates. Higher prices may make customers more inclined to reconsider before canceling their reservations.
    - Sending email reminders about bookings to stay connected and showcase the company's level of service. Informing customers that the deadline is approaching with details about the cancellation policy can help.
    - Instead of canceling reservations, the company can offer rescheduling and sell rooms with longer lead times. <br>
